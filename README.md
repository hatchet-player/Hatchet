# Hatchet

Hatchet is a free multi-source and cross-platform music player. An application that can play not only your local files, but also stream from services like Spotify, Beats, SoundCloud, Google Music, YouTube and many others. You can even connect with your friends' Hatchets, share your musical gems or listen along with them. Let the music play!

## How Hatchet Works

Hatchet is basically a **player for music metadata**. At its core it decouples the metadata about a song from the source and reassembles it for each user based on their individual music accessibility and rights. In short, given the name of a song and artist, Hatchet will find the right source, for the right user at the right time.  This fundamentally different approach to music enables a range of new music consumption and sharing experiences previously not possible.

Third party-developed resolvers have also been written for services like YouTube, Qobuz and others. We've also heard of digital music distributors writing their own for their internal CMSes to help them navigate and preview their content. That's cool.

Packaged binary resolvers (.axes) are available: [here](http://teom.org/axes).

Source code (and examples) can be found in our [Resolver repository](https://github.com/hatchet-player/hatchet-resolvers).
